# use asyncio.gather() to bundle async executions together and add them to the event loop.
# use the return_exceptions=True flag if you want one task throwing an exception to 
# prevent other async tasks from being run.
# This ensures that one task in a bundle failing causes all tasks to fail.
# The same can be achieved with using an async context mananger, like asyncio.TaskGroup
# No need to physically write await with the context manager, it is automatically handled.
# Execution time is 2 seconds for each of the above methods to bundle coroutines/tasks together.
